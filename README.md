# Gmail Archive Button 
I like to archive my emails so that they get out of my inbox but are still accessible in a search.

Gmail doesn't make it easy to quickly access your archived emails so I've created [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmail-archive-button/moaeggeibodfhcohjicpmedcngeikcda/related?hl=en-US&gl=US) to provide quick access.
